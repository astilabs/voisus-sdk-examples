Voisus C++ SDK Example

This is C++ starter code for working with the Voisus Client.

Voisus.cpp and Voisus.h provide the VoisusPlugin native library which wraps around the VRCC library.

voisus-sdk-example.cpp is a simple console application that connects to a server, picks a role, and prints out the nets.
